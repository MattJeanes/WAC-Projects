Hi Sentry.

I'mma need you firstly to hack off the wheels while keeping the whole landing gear type thing, and give those wheels a custom collision model so they can wheel around and shit.

Secondly I'mma need you to take off all of the rotors, and make them into another custom prop with a custom collision model with 2 bodygroups, blurred and not blurred.

Then send me back the smds to fuck around with and compile and shit.

Dr. Matt.

p.s. kthx
